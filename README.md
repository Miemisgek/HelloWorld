# Period Saver 

#<i>Description</i>
<p>When women start having their period and realize that they do not have any sanitary pads within reach they don't feel very comfortable. This is where Period Saver comes in. When a woman opens this app a list of other women (who happen to have sanitary pads) is shown. These women are nearby. The woman can ask them for help by sending them a text or Whatsapp message. They decide a place where they can meet to hand over some sanitary pads. </p>
